        <p>I recently fell into a rabbit hole about the "handmade web," and really ugly or primitive-looking websites. I don't know why I find it so fascinating. I think I like anything that has the impression of being "handmade," or not mass-produced or easily recreated. It somehow feels more authentic, even if it's really not. I am having a lot of fun, but I also feel overwhelmed. I am almost 50% of the way through SuperHi's "Learn to Code Now" eBook. It makes HTML/CSS a lot less scary. To be fair, I have also had some exposure through blogging and Tumblr so maybe that helps...</p>
        <p>I wish I could be honest, but the Internet is scary, and I can be discovered anywhere. I feel a lot of pressure to build some kind of online presence because it's good for my ~career.~ Oversharing on the Internet has always felt a bit cathartic but my desire to overshare has waned over the past two years. I am glad I am doing less of that. The Internet needs to be reduced to cat memes, not those strange, unnerving memes that Gen-Z's are known for.</p>
        <p>As of today, this page is looking a little...basic. Which is okay. I like the handmade web because it's more flexible. I think my creative projects need to be low maintenance. I hate visual studio code because I can't tell if I misspelled anything or not.</p>
