        <p>Today, Kyle and I went to the Midwest Vintage Flea Market which was hosted in the Garver Feed Mill venue right behind the Olbirch Gardens. It was really busy and a little overwhelming, but I had a nice time. I wish I actually bought something...probably best that I didn't. Also inside Garver Feed Mill was Ian's Pizza and a coffee shop I can't remember the name of.</p>
        <p>After going to the flea market, we headed down to the Capitol to go to the Dane County Farmers Market–our first of the season. We parked in the State Street garage and stopped by the "world's biggest cheese store" (or whatever they claim to be) and tried cheese samples. I liked the caramel cheese, even though it was a little weird.</p>
        <p>We stopped by a booth that had giant gooey cookies. Kyle chose chocolate chip and blueberry cheesecake. Then, we went to Wonderstate Coffee where I got a small iced americano and Kyle got a cold brew. I considered getting matcha, but it's easier to stick with ol'reliable. We sat at a window for a few minutes while we tried the blueberry cookie which was just white chocolate (still really good–and sweet). Kyle claims that the CEO of his company drives a Tesla.</p>
        <p>We continued to walk around the Farmers Market. Kyle noticed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhubarb">rhubarb</a> was a popular offering. We figured that maybe it's an early spring vegetable. Kyle is excited to get his vegetable box from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games">work</a>.</p>
        <p>Later, we went to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-globe-madison">The Globe</a> for lunch. I had heard good things, so I was eager to try it. I was surprised by how small it was, but it felt authentic. I got korean bbq tacos while Kyle got dumplings. I really liked the tacos.</p>
        <p>After that we went home. I fell asleep on the couch. Zzz.</p>
